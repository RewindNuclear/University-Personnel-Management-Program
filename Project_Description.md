# University-Personnel-Management-Program

Project Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Java Code utilizes objects, structs, abstract classes, abstract methods, and method overriding 

This project involves implementing a simple university personnel management program. The program contains three kinds 
of objects: Staff, student and faculty. For each object, the program stores relevant information such as university ID, name, 
etc. Different information is stored depending on the type of the object. For example, a student has a GPA, a faculty has a 
title and department (professor, mathematics).

Context
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first project where I was able to lead. We were placed in teams of 3 where one person was designated as team leader. My teamates voted me, so as team leader
I came up with an outline of how our code should function. I overlooked debugging and was able to divide the work to suit my team members' strengths. I assisted in most 
aspects of the code if my team members were stuggling. This first experience taught me how to communicate effectively, and how to lead professional enviornment.
